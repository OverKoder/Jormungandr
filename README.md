# Jormungandr: An Agent that plays the snake game!

This personal projects aims to:
- Solve this problem algorithmically with the A* algorithm, implemented from scratch to use as pathfinding.
- Implement most of the tabular reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Implement some deep learning algorithms.

# How to use
Clone the repository, and run the file Snake_game.py on the command line! There are two possible options:
- -d: The difficulty of the game, it's an integer in the range from 1 to 5, and it just makes the game go slower or faster respectively.
- -hh: Heuristic: It can be 'manhattan' or 'euclidean'. The A* algorithm behaves differently when changing the Heuristic, the manhattan distance will make the snake move only up, down, left or right. The euclidean distance will make it move diagonally.

# Requirements
pygame >= 2.1.2
